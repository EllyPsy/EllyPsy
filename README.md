I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Science, Policy and Management (Sustainability Education) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), working under the guidance of Prof. Tai Kai NG and Prof. Alexis LAU.

I learned my Master of Social Science in Psychology (Educational Stream) from The City University of Hong Kong (CityU) and my Master of Science in Sustainable Urban Development from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and I received my Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Design from Nanjing Forestry University.

I have also gained valuable hands-on research experience through my roles as a research assistant at HKUST and CityU, and a research intern at The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, contributing to projects that explore AI-assisted educational psychology and innovative learning environments.

- üåê My research explores how psychological insights can make AI not only smarter and more adaptable in uncertain environments but also **truly explainable**.
- üßê If you‚Äôre interested in collaborating on projects at the intersection of psychology, education, and AI‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs developing adaptive learning tools, designing transparent decision-making models, or exploring how cognitive heuristics enhance algorithmic efficiency‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to connect!
