I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Science, Policy and Management (with a focus on Sustainability Education) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of Prof. Tai Kai NG and Prof. Alexis LAU. To further my research, I am currently a Visiting Scholar at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), working with Prof. Albert Ziegler, which provides me with invaluable international perspectives on educational assessment and research methodologies.

I hold a Master of Social Science in Psychology (Educational Stream) from The City University of Hong Kong (CityU), a Master of Science in Sustainable Urban Development from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Design from Nanjing Forestry University.

Through my roles as a research assistant at HKUST and CityU, and as a research intern at The University of Hong Kong and The Chinese University of Hong Kong, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in educational and psychological research. I have contributed to multiple projects involving AI-assisted educational psychology and innovative learning environments, with a strong emphasis on quantitative analysis, measurement methodologies, and the application of advanced statistical tools.

📊 My research focuses on integrating psychological and educational principles into assessment technology, with expertise in applying statistical models—including familiarity with item response theory—to enhance the validity, reliability, and fairness of assessments.

🎯 I am particularly interested in developing and refining assessment systems that are not only adaptive and data-informed but also transparent and equitable, aligning with international best practices in educational measurement.
